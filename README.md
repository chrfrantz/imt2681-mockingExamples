# imt2681-mockingExamples
Brief demos for testing using overriding function pointers, httptest servers, mocking using gomock and use of assert statements as shown in IMT2681 - Cloud Technologies

To run the examples, you will need to download the gomock, mockgen and testify packages (in addition to the Go environment).

```
go get github.com/golang/mock/gomock
go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen
go get github.com/stretchr/testify
```
